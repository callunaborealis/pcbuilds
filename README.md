# PC Builds

An attempt to replicate the compatibility checking system for [PCPartPickers](https://sg.pcpartpicker.com) but this will allow any part to be used. Mostly for personal use for making my dream build.

```sh
npm install # Install packages
npm start # Check if hardcoded case is compatible with hardcoded GPU
```
